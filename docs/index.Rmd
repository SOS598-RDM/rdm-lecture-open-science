**reproducible research** is the ability to recompute data analytic results, given an observed data set and knowledge of the data analysis pipeline.

**reproducibility for scientific reasons**

* increased trustworthiness
* more rigorous, reliable science
* learning more from one another's work

**reproducibility for personal reasons**

- helps researchers remember how and why they did *x*
- enables researchers to quickly and simply modify figures, tables, etc.
- enables quick reconfiguration of previously conducted research tasks

  Several researchers have apparently asked to see Imperial's calculations, but
  Prof. Neil Ferguson, the man leading the team, has said that <mark>the
  computer code is 13 years old and thousands of lines of it "undocumented,"
  making it hard for anyone to work with, let alone take it apart to identify
  potential errors</mark>. He has promised that it will be published in a week
  or so, but in the meantime reasonable people might wonder whether something
  made with 13-year-old, undocumented computer code should be used to justify
  shutting down the economy. Meanwhile, the authors of the Oxford model have
  promised that their code will be published "as soon as possible."

Yet because open science can encompass all steps of the scientific process, it
is natural that it means different things to different people: One can open the
process of *data collection, data analysis, computer code, manuscript writing,
data publishing, and scholarly publication (to name a few)*. If you type “open
science” into a search engine, you would pull up thousands of hits that do any,
all, or none of these things.

# why publish data

* big picture
  + increasingly a requirement
  + advancement of science
  
* researcher perspective
  + papers with publicly available data receive a higher number of citations than similar studies lacking available data<sup>1</sup>
  + data sharing is associated with higher productivity
  + a citeable product

Without clear instructions, many researchers struggle to avoid chaos in their
file structures, and so are understandably reluctant to expose their workflow
for others to see. This may be one of the reasons that so many requests for
details about method, including requests for data and code, are turned down or
go unanswered.
